# Probabilistic Analysis

This analysis refers to uncertainity, both model uncertainity and data uncertainity.
It is based on the use of probabilistic models and deep neural networks. It is distinguished using two approaches to probabilistic deep learning: probabilistic neural networks and deep probabilistic models.
